### The website
What do the numbers and data tell us about Singapore? Let's find out together! Join me as I use publicly available data to create (hopefully) nice-looking charts and try to understand what is going on in Singapore. 

### Me
I am a PhD student with joint supervision from the behavioural science and statistics departments at the University of Warwick, UK. Yes, I am also a Singaporean!

## The website
What do the numbers and data tell us about [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore)? Let's find out together! Join me as I use publicly available data to create (hopefully) nice-looking charts and try to understand what is going on in Singapore.

## Me
<img src="/img/Kenneth_Lim.jpg" alt="Kenneth Lim" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;float: left;width: 250px;"/>I am a PhD student with joint supervision from the [behavioural science group](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/research/specialisms/teaching-groups/bs/) and [department of statistics](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/), UK.
